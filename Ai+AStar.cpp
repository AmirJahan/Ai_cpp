    AStar Search ~ The Efficient Explorer ~ The Smart Navigator
    Not only do you explore the maze like Dijkstra, keeping track of the easiest paths,
    but also how close you are to target. Balancing between how far you’ve gone 
    and how close you think you are to the exit.

    Having a map and a compass, you can find the best path to the exit.


    Summary
        •	DFS is like diving deep into one path until you hit a dead end, then backtracking.
        •	BFS is like exploring all nearby paths step by step, making sure you find the shortest way.
        •	Dijkstra is like planning the easiest path, avoiding difficult spots.
        •	A* is like using both a map and a compass to find the quickest and easiest way to the exit.


    	A* is powerful and versatile when:
	•	You have a good heuristic.
	•	You want to balance cost and proximity to the goal.
	•	You need the optimal and most efficient solution.
	•	BFS is best when:
	•	You need the shortest path, and all moves have the same cost.
	•	You have a small grid or graph, and simplicity is key.
	•	DFS is useful when:
	•	You’re exploring deeply structured problems, like mazes, puzzles, or tree-like structures.
	•	Memory efficiency is a concern.
	•	Dijkstra is ideal when:
	•	You’re navigating weighted graphs and need to find the least costly path without needing a heuristic.
	•	A* is impractical because you can’t define a good heuristic.

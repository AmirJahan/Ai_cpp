/*
    Djikstra's Algorithm ~ The careful planner
    You start from the entrance and keep track of the easiest way to get to each room, 
    one step at a time, until you find the best path to the exit.



    	•	Dijkstra: While guaranteed to find the least costly path, Dijkstra can be 
        inefficient in large grids because it explores every possible path without 
        regard for how close the nodes are to the goal. It can be slow in real-time 
        scenarios where speed matters.

	•	A*: Typically faster because it uses the heuristic to skip unpromising nodes 
    and focus on those that are likely to lead to the goal. This makes A* more efficient
     in many real-world scenarios, particularly when the heuristic is well-chosen.
